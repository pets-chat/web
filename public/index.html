      <p class="font-bold">There's not much to talk about when it comes to us. We're a diverse friend group on Telegram which enjoys talking about (among other things): politics, electronics, technology and science. We do the occasional thing together and we're a closed community (but happy to invite the right people on board).</p>
      <p>Our rules for getting involved in our chat is pretty simple:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="font-bold">Don't be vitriolic:</span> This means keep toxicity out of the group. Do not flame users individually or as a group, do not troll (as in posting things just to annoy other people), do not harass, and do not make offensive or harsh statements where you know this will anger or hurt others.</li>
        <li><span class="font-bold">Demonstrate a willingless to learn:</span> This is a safe space. Anyone can make a mistake and say something hurtful or triggering. If you find youself corrected for making this error, please try to learn from it. This is not a place to tell people that they need to reclaim prejoratives so you can use it, that they should laugh at jokes against them, or that they should stop being a snowflake.</li>
